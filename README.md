# Sitch Self-Signed Seeder
## A task for generating self-signed crypto material for Logstash, and injecting into Vault
## Designed for use with SITCH Sensor Mk3

You'll need the following environment variable set:

| Variable           | Purpose                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| VAULT_URL          | URL for vault server         |
| VAULT_TOKEN        | Root token for vault         |
| LS_CLIENTNAME      | CN for Logstash client       |
| LS_SERVERNAME      | CN for Logstash server       |


Here's the skinny:  Run this task with the right creds and you'll be returned
the following on stdout:

* logstash server vault token
* logstash client vault token

These will give you access to the credentials auto-generated by this tool and
inserted into your Vault.  The paths for accessing these credentials are:

| Path                     | Purpose            |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| /server/cert    | Logstash server certifcate  |
| /server/key     | Logstash server key         |
| /client/ca      | CA certificate for client   |
| /client/cert    | Logstash client certificate |
| /client/key     | Logstash client key         |

The first portion of the path represents the token required to access the
credential.

This goes into your sitch sensor and logstash server configuration.  Using this
will allow a rapid re-key of your log delivery infrastructure.  Create a new
Vault and kick this off.  When it completes, place the tokens in your delivery
system (resin.io application environment variable for the sensor, and whatever
your container orchestration system is for the Logstash server).  Then restart
your Logstash server container and Resin application with the new credentials.
Voila.
